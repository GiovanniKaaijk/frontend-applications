## Wiki

Follow the progress on the [wiki](https://github.com/GiovanniKaaijk/frontend-applications/wiki).

## Description

During this course I created a web app with React. The data I use comes from [Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed](https://www.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/). The user has the ability to search their favorite vacation spot. The Detail page shows the different object that could have been found at that spot over time together with information about the objects.
